         <h2>WHAT IS ONLINE THERAPY?</h2>
         <p class="">My goal is to make high-quality psychological support more affordable and accessible, wherever you are. I believe that having good mental health and well being should be available to everyone, and that means accessing a psychologist should also be available to everyone, no matter where you are located or what hours you work.</p>
         <p class="">Online therapy is just like in-person therapy, except we&rsquo;re talking through a screen rather than sitting across from each other in the same room. Also called video-, or Skype-therapy or telepsychology, online therapy has been shown to be an effective form of therapy.</p>

        <h2>IS ONLINE THERAPY RIGHT FOR ME?</h2>
        <p class="">Online therapy works just the same way as in-person therapy. The advantage of doing therapy online, however, is that it gives you greater flexibility and is a cost-effective option.</p>
        <p class="">Online therapy is:</p>
        <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>
        <p class="">Flexible - make appointments that suit your schedule</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="">Available from anywhere - whether you are on holiday or travelling for work, you can continue to access therapy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="">Cost effective - being online means I can reduce my overheads, and pass this saving on to you</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="">Time effective - no need to travel to a therapist&rsquo;s office</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="">All from the comfort of your own home! (or wherever you choose)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WHO IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THERAPY ONLINE?</h2>
        <p class="">Online therapy is not appropriate where you need crisis intervention or where your life may be at risk through suicide. Further, if there are concerns about the wellbeing of children under the age of 16 online therapy may not be appropriate.</p>
        <p class="">Severe and enduring presentations that require management by a multidisciplinary team are also not appropriate for online therapy, this includes psychosis, anorexia and bipolar disorder.</p>

        <h2>PREPARING FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT</h2>
        <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>
        <p class="">Please find a <strong>private space</strong> where you will not be disturbed during your appointment. If you usually have children at home, please make alternative arrangements for their care. It is important that you are able to talk freely during your therapy appointment in order to get the most out of our time together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="">I recommend you have a <strong>pen and paper</strong> handy at the time of your appointment to allow you to make notes of things you may want to remember later.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="">Before our appointment, please <strong>check your internet and computer system</strong> are working by going to www.zoom.us/test. You can download the app for iPhone, android or tablet, or download the free software if you&rsquo;re planning to use a computer.</p>
